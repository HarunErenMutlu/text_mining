warning spoiler included review doesnt really make much difference deep impact begin official summer movie season also  back memory remember date peak came  month later volcano  first film smart  one best disaster film ever seen latter film cohesive mess  logic wasted talent well   two disaster film go head head competition time unfortunately first comet flick bad people may shy away  upcoming   beginning  course general reaction audience opposed mine minority stood side date peak watching deep impact  wonder anyone right mind could actually like film apparently many utterly  completely honest havent little fun watching disaster film entire life volcano implausibility zoo still rather fun watch deep impact doesnt implausibility also  cheap human drama incredibly horrible special effect poorly  plot thing give half star bottom  slightly entertaining final fifteen minute good actor making character deep impact begin unnamed year year  advanced technology set future fire sky

relationship form impending doom final moment  two character heartfelt emotional shame nothing else heartfelt course know comet doe impact surface title alone  preview actually show absolutely tension drawn attempt stop comet know wont work director  leader came successful try direction episode hit television show er major film debut pacemaker pathetic harmless action film well time leader   film worse one suggestion leader please stay away big screen least action genre much blame  leader directly pace disastrous throughout film given subtitle tell u much time  go month week hour literally feel like lapsed time taking place  boring course leader  blame screenwriter       simplistic story get worse time start promising soon turn deadly audience anyway check full cheese one liner know going sex anyone else school stupid character might think back one subplot remotely interesting rest unforgettable boring main plot outrageous cant figure film supposed action drama  put simply special effect film hit miss situation thats right miss hit scene earth well done  ship majestic comet huge mistake making laughable frightening concept even trying land comet preposterous enough thats    actually  human walk surface give break course much hoped collision comet earth well far spectacular make independence day look brilliant water rushing towards land effective hit continent

situation leader like plant people fear via face instead coming sympathetic leader  assist one moment astronaut flying space enough warrant response audience leader want go farther show u person face drifting space one  way illicit emotional response audience one going  another note leader film pick pace last fifteen minute comet actually impact pace doe pick emotional moment shown watch people cry  one obvious emotional mostly big trick rope viewer feeling character didnt work anyway actor much given  bad boy  naked truth best film given easiest role character made  tennis presence grow care  dual energetic fun watch character turned shed plot  wood also come rather successfully still  many good role wood stick drama talented stuff   barely knowledgeable performance enhanced strong presence screen  shell  doe provide nice humor morgan freeman infinitely better give one shallow performance date quite remarkable   could better think  poorly written character special note go  elder dense  elder good role limited plot  special personally  yar  star trek next generation seeing one highlight film overall talented cast virtually wasted deep impact rated  disaster related element brief language one worst film year omen thing come summer could one worst ever lucky file movie coming hopefully  successful shame film successfully  worth much costing nearly million special effect done illustrious film huge  score composed   corner titanic one might  fun witness experience well comet doe hit earth almost wish could take film along
